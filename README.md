I see your anxious heart. During all the time, you were considering to
have a specific living form, werenâ€™t you? Senses are always actual
humanly preferred. Abstract thoughts are regarded as a perpetual and
compulsive repetition of reckoning and calculating.

Strange feelings. After an experience of depression, the drug could give you a feeling like be in heaven, but that is not real. All the time I am considering what is real, true or right. So many times I thought people with an experience of something like hypomania must have the ability to manage something.
This night I want to learn something about magic, about AP Computer Science A.

A quick roam:
- Learn something about AP Calculus BC.
- Learn something about combinatorics.
- Learn something about number theory.
    
Trying to improve your score via taking pills is not available. All the exciting feelings make you stupid.

I just want to learn about Vim! Just kidding! It is worthless to spend time learning something just as a tool for programmers but the purpose of mine is the academic studies!
Now it is quite a challenge for me to complete the course Object Oriented Programming in Java Specialization before enrolling my high school.
A journey to College Board.
After the communication with my high school math teacher, I consider that I must have a plan before learning. For example in this case it better for me to enroll the AP program first rather the course in Coursera. And preparing for AMC preview is still better than IMO, just basic principles in economics.
Learn something about AP Calculus BC.

Good...night? Alright I am going to learn something about AP Computer Science A right now.
I also consider that I might want to certain my profile photo via taking a picture of my Koishi Komeiji fumo.
I must admit this looks perfect! Koishi Komeiji is cute!
Tracing and writing code on paper is quite boring, but it is easy to do.
Imperfect is the fact of the natural world, but the word is defined by humans. We are always legal to define which is perfect by ourselves not others. The only truth is to be better, not be perfect.
Sometimes I consider that why the courses I'm taking now which to prepare for the exams could not be as interesting as the ones such as SICP in MIT. But the truth which I noticed is that if you really want to join the fun classes, you should first be enrolled to MIT.

How do we define Nihilism?
The benefit, in emotional, is equal to the benefit you could get while just thinking the same thing, but the general benefit is certainly greater than the one during thinking. I use the word "thinking" here rather "considering", which has a reason that "considering" is more like an academic concept.
All the times before I was considering a statement for my mind. I tried to imagine utopia, to build up website or look for note-taking apps to store my legacy as a statement. But that is not real. Physical things as we known could now store your soul. Your existence is just the statement, of everything. Space is your mind. You chose stay here at Roam Research is just because you like writing things here, whatever the content is. Maybe you've attracted by the beauty of the software, or some memories you couldn't forget. I see all the things around me, my friends, my families, my school, is all the things I have, I own, and they are the only one truth, about existence itself. Therefore it wise to consider everything with a marginal trade-off, which could chill your mind, and heal your pain. You are able to forgive yourself anytime.

- Today is a special day, isn't it?
- During all the time you are considering to have a specific living form, don't you?
- What did I miss?
- So many times you were considering whether using `\frac` or `\dfrac` [...](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/satori/page/62ceJHbDi) you cleaned up the whole drop. Now It's time to end up this mess.
- What I am going to say that today is such a special day. Human always follows their senses.
- We always prefer beauty rather ugly, even if the beauty couldn't make any scientific sense.
- The economics taught us to make trade-offs all the time, but how could drugs control human's brain?
---
- Time to get serious. Now try to learn something about derivative preview!
- So first of all I considered that if something want to learn something, it is important for him to be excited, whatever they have taken pills or not, this doesn't matter. You must understand that the meaning of everything has a cost here, which means despite the side effects, you choose to learn about something new. I knew the truth you can always learn free any time you want, but the fact which happened in the past usually reflects the truth which is capable to the future.
- I hope the stuff below could give a show of my study row, where first start with Understanding Derivatives & Chain Rule | Live Review Session 1 | AP Calculus AB.
- I believe I've down most of the fundamental jobs on the journey of derivatives. Time to have fun!
- Songs and videos always have the ability to relax people:
    - Quadratic Formula Song.
    - The hardest problem on the hardest test.
- During the residual time I plan to do a preview of mechanics, which is involved in AP Physics C: Mechanics.
